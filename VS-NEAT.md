# Differences between swirlnet and NEAT

While some features in NEAT are currently missing, others are intentionally
excluded or changed.

## Expanded options for disablement during crossover

The original [NEAT](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/neat.html)
[paper](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf) seems to
suggest that new genomes produced through crossover should randomly inherit the
disablement of a connection gene if it is disabled in either parent, regardless
of the relative fitness of the parent carrying the disabled gene.

This leads to a choice between, at one extreme, allowing rather frequent
inheritance of disablement from weak parents, or rarely inheriting disablement
from fit parents, at the other. Since relative fitness determines which parent
passes on excess and disjoint genes, neither option is appealing as both
options frequently disrupt effective structure. Attempting to compromise with a
fifty percent chance of inheriting disablement from either parent leads to
frequently disrupted structure in both of these problematic scenarios. This is
caused by an effective double bind due to there being only one probability
covering multiple scenarios.

swirlnet gives you flexible options through seven probability settings.

* Firstly, you have the option of of using these settings to disable the
  special inheritance rules for gene disablement.

    * This causes disablement and enablement to be inherited along with
      connection weight according to the gene inheritance rules.

* You can set gene disablement status to always be inherited from the gene of
  the fitter parent, along with other structural differences.

    * In the case of the XOR challenge, this setting and settings with similar
      probabilities are the most effective options I've tried since they reduce
      attraction to the the local minimum of creating genomes with every
      connection gene disabled. Without this type of inheritance, connections
      often become disabled when a weak genome with an added (and reconnected)
      node and disabled (short) connection reproduces with a fitter genome. The
      additional connected node is not inherited from the weaker genome since
      it is either disjoint or excess; if the disabled connection is randomly
      inherited from the weaker genome then the result is a new genome with a
      missing connection. Once all connections are deleted, genomes always
      create the same output that is situated half way between the correct and
      incorrect answer for every XOR test case. In early stages of evolution,
      this disconnected genome may outperform connected genomes. Using the
      above approach solves this particular issue.

* By changing four settings in swirlnet you may differentiate the probabilities
  of inheriting disablement, inheriting enablement or non-interference, each
  according to whether the fitter or weaker parent has the disabled gene.

* You may set the gene enablement rate for cases in which both parents' genes
  are disabled.

* You can also set the frequency of asexual gene disablement toggling with two
  settings, one for the rate of enablement, the other for the rate of
  disablement.

* Tweaking these settings allows you to follow the same, or a similar, approach
  as the one outlined in the original NEAT paper.

The additional rules for sexually inherited disablement occur after each
connection weight is randomly inherited from either parent.

## Genomes with equal fitness

If two genomes with equal fitness scores are undergoing crossover, one of them
is treated as the fitter genome by swirlnet. Excess and disjoint genes are
inherited from the 'fitter' parent instead of randomly inheriting disjoint and
excess genes from both.

Removing this feature decreased code complexity and increased the rate at which
solutions to a prior (albeit naive) version of the XOR problem were found. The
prior behavior may be re-added later if found to be useful.

## Weight mutation control

swirlnet offers expanded options for controlling weight mutation compared to
suggestions in the original NEAT paper. One has the option of setting the
uniform gene perturbation, unique gene perturbation and unique gene weight
reset rates. The sum of these rates may be less than 1 in order to allow some
weights in a genome undergoing weight mutation to remain unmutated.

swirlnet uses Gaussian distributions to set new weights and perturb existing
ones.

## Other differences

There are likely many other undocumented ways in which this library differs
from other implementations of NEAT.
